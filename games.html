            <p>This was a game project for an FBLA completion, that I, along with 2 other team members created. We placed first in both Regionals and States and are currently going to compete in the National competition in Chicago this July. The object of the game is that you were an antivirus software and your objective is to destroy viruses in a computer terminal. We spent around a month working on the game, and it was a very interesting collaborative experience.</p>

            </header>
            <p>As a team we came up with the concept for the game and overall direction of the art style. However, in order to complete the project in time we decided on 3 roles for the team. One person would be the main programmer, another would work on the 2d assets like the interface, and incorporate the educational portion into the project, this was my role, and another would focus on creating all the audio in the game.</p>

                </header>
                 <p>The presentation, found <a href="CompGame&SimProgram_PwrPnt_NEW.pdf"> here</a>, was very business oriented because we had to "sell" the game to the judges during our state competition. Having to stand in front of the judges and present was a great experience for as it helped me get over my stage fright and take on a business persona which I need if I want to become a game developer in the future.</p>
