            <p>My name is Derick Wells, and I am a currently a high school senior, about to graduate, with a very logical and artistic outlook. Over my high school years I’ve spent considerable amount of my time involved in either graphical design, programming, or story writing. I plan to go to college for a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Game Design, and combining all of my skills and becoming an Indie Game Developer.

When I’m not working on projects I spend a lot of free time browsing creative sites such as Creative Bloq and DeviantArt, listening to music on Spotify or SoundCloud, and playing video games or watching anime.
