                <h2><span>A Modest Proposal.</span></h2>
            </header>
            <p>The modest proposal essay was a personal take on the satirical article by Jonathan Swift called a "Modest Proposal". The object of the essay was to find a problem in society that isn't widely known and create a satirical response to bring attention to it. For me, my topic was on the rising number of selfish and spoiled teenagers in America. For the article click <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxqcg8AcGvTffkVZdHhKYTFta0dGMk5aTzFINVA0MG1xRVQtLVc5dXZkamJQMzNDbmdlVTg&usp=sharing">here</a>.
         </p>
             <p>I believe this essay was one of my favorite essays I've written in school. It forced me out of my comfort zone to write something I've never done before, satire. Satire itself is a very difficult concept to pull off effectively. It is very easy to simply miss the point of the article and focus on having too shocking of a response. So it was certainly one of the more difficult articles I've written.</p>
             
             <p>Despite never tackling the concept of satire before, I felt that this was one of the stronger essays I've written. One of my strongest points was the use of references and allusions, in order to get my point across without sounding too descriptive. I based most of my ideas on pop-culture references, e.g. Hunger Games and Fallout. Another piece I felt very confident in was the speech. I really had to go out of my comfort zone when making that, but I'm very glad I did as it really allowed me to immerse myself in the essay.</p>
             
             <p>There was a lot of good I did with that essay, but there were some pieces that I skipped out on. I do feel the article as a whole was well written, but if I had spent a bit longer I feel it could have been better. Though I clearly failed on the art aspect, despite priding myself as an artist I clearly let that part of my assignment fall to the wayside. I had a good concept for it, but in the end I didn't manage my time well and was forced to make a poor auto-generated cartoon. In the end though I feel like this essay was a very good experience for me.</p>

                <h2><span>Multi-Genre Research.</span></h2>                
            </header>
            <p>The Multi-Genre research essay was definitively my absolute favorite essay that I had written in my entire 4 years of high school, it can be found <a href="Multi-Genre%20Research%20Assignment.pdf">here</a>. In short it was a research paper about a chosen topic, mine was "The Correlation between Graphic Media and Crime.", and it featured multiple genres of writing to convey your message.</p>
            
            <p>It was the first time I got to both choose a non-fictional topic and still use my fictional story writing abilities in the essay. It really allowed me to do what I do best in writing, and that is writing stories. The fictional piece which was, "A Short Story of a Teenage Boy" on page 3, was still based on a real life concept and situation that happens far too often. </p>
            
            <p>Outside of the fictional role of the paper the rest of the research paper I equally loved. I got to go out of the normal restrictions of school papers to get my point across and that included an article about pornography. I was able to use any legitamate article I found in order to get my message across. I enjoyed this because I believe we as seniors are adult enough to handle the real world...well most of us anyway.</p>

                <h2><span>Future Career.</span></h2>
            </header>
            <p>While this piece was not technically an essay, it was a very important assignment to me as it allowed me to show what I really wanted to be in the next 5-10 years. It was a presentation on the future career or college you wanted to attend. The full presentation can be viewed <a href="Wells_D_VideoGameDesigner.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I've wanted to become an Indie Game Developer ever since entering High School, and it's a true passion of mine. I would give anything required to get to that level and I believe that this article allowed me to show both why I would do that, and what I've already done to start reaching for that goal.</p>

                <h2><span>Game Script Excerpt.</span></h2>
            </header>
                <p>This piece, <a href="Main%20Story.pdf">here</a>, was something that I created for a game in my ATC class. I plan to take this script further over the next few years and use it in a very large game project, and as it is it's currently over 200 pages. This excerpt is the opening scene. Looking back on it script writing was something I found a passion for in my senior year and I find it very interesting. Whereas in a normal English paper there's a list of rules that you have to follow, in script writing the rules are more a template that you can customize to your will. I also enjoy how dialog is very separate from the action sequences in script writing. You do this so you can easily give to another individual later and they know exactly how the scene you've written is supposed to look. It's less about crafting a world with descriptive language and more about creating that world with literal terminology, which works well with the more logical side of my brain.</p>
                
                <p>Onto the actual article itself the weaknesses aren't readily apparent to the normal person, but for someone who reads scripts its clear I'm a novice. The correct terminology to use in which situation is something I still struggle to accomplish, as I try to get over using descriptive language and instead using more literal terms. That being said, this is definitely the best scene I've written, in terms of describing what is happening, and giving descriptions of characters.</p>
