                <h2><span>A Modest Proposal.</span></h2>
            </header>
            <p>The modest proposal essay was a personal take on the satirical article by Jonathan Swift called a "Modest Proposal". The object of the essay was to find a problem in society that isn't widely known and create a satirical response to bring attention to it. For me, my topic was on the rising number of selfish and spoiled teenagers in America. For the article click <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxqcg8AcGvTffkVZdHhKYTFta0dGMk5aTzFINVA0MG1xRVQtLVc5dXZkamJQMzNDbmdlVTg&usp=sharing">here</a>.
         </p>
             <p>I believe this essay was one of my favorite essays I've written in school. As it forced me out of my comfort zone to write something I've never done before, being satire. Satire itself is a very difficult concept to pull off effectively anyway. As it's very hard to find to simply miss the point of the article and focus on having too shocking of a response. So it was certainly one of the more difficult articles I've written.</p>
             
             <p>Despite never tackling the concept of satire before however, I felt that this was one of the stronger essays I've written. And I feel like one of my strong points was the use of references and allusions. In order to get my point across without sounding too descriptive I based most of my ideas on pop-culture references, e.g. Hunger Games and Fallout. Also, I felt very confident in the speech I had to do of the clip. I really had to go out of my comfort zone when making that, but I'm very glad I did as it really allowed me to immerse myself in the essay.</p>
             
             <p>There was a lot of good I did with that essay, but there were some pieces that I skipped out on. I did feel the article as a whole was well written, but if I had spent a bit longer it could have been better. Though I clearly failed on the art aspect, despite priding myself as an artist I clearly let that part of my assignment fall to the wayside. I had a good concept for it, but in the end I didn't manage my time well and was forced to make a poor auto-generated cartoon. In the end though I feel like this essay was a very good experience for me.</p>

                <h2><span>Multi-Genre Research.</span></h2>                
            </header>
            <p>The Multi-Genre research essay was definitively my absolute favorite essay that I had written in my entire 4 years of high school, it can be found <a href="Multi-Genre%20Research%20Assignment.pdf">here</a>. In short it was a research paper about a chosen topic, mine was "The Correlation between Graphic Media and Crime.", and it featured multiple genres of writing to convey your message.</p>
            
            <p>It was the first time I got to both choose a non-fictional topic and still use my fictional story writing abilities in the essay. It really allowed me to do what I do best in writing, and that is writing stories. The fictional piece which was, "A Short Story of a Teenage Boy" on page 3, was still based on a real life concept and situation that happens far to often. </p>
            
            <p>Outside of the fictional realm though the rest of the research paper I equally loved. I got to go out of the normal restrictions of school papers to get my point across and that included an article about pornography. I really enjoyed how I was able to use any legitimate article I found in order to get my message across which I enjoyed because I believe we seniors are adult enough to handle the real world...well most of us anyway.</p>

                <h2><span>Future Career.</span></h2>
            </header>
            <p>While this piece was not technically an essay, it was a very important assignment to me as it allowed me to show what I really wanted to be in the next 5-10 years. It was a presentation on the future career or college you wanted to attend. The full presentation can be viewed <a href="Wells_D_VideoGameDesigner.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I've wanted to become an Indie Game Developer ever since entering High School, and it's a true passion of mine. I would give anything required to get to that level and I believe that this article allowed me to show both why I would do that, and what I've already done to start reaching for that goal.</p>
